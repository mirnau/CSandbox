This is a playground where I implement Direct3D in a C-environment.
I am using the following resources:

* ChiliTomatoNoodle (Direct3D C++ tutorials)
* TheCherno (Game Engine Series)
* MSDN DirectX11 docs

The project is built with bat files that rely on
* CMAKE
* gcc makefiles
* MinGW32-x64

Some header libraries are/will be used, as for example:
* HandmadeMaths.h (for SIMD optimized algebra calculations)

GOALS:
* Explore C-syntax,
* Explore and understand Win32 API better
* Explore and understand the DirectX11 pipline better
* Understand memory management better
* Learn to compile and debug from neovim, to not be overreliant on Visual Studio
* Eventually render Sponsa

Caveat:
As I am learning by doing this code will be full of weird decisions and memory leaks,
I will improve it as I learn and play around in my sandbox.
